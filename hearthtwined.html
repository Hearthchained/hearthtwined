You love the FUCK out of SLASH. In fact, you might describe yourself as a SLASH FANGIRL.

You spend much of your time voraciously consuming ALL FORMS OF MEDIA that you can get your hands on, but recently your attention has been captured by the television show SUPERNATURAL. This is because you think that JENSEN ACKLES is dreamy. You also fancy yourself a DEFT HAND at WRITING FAN FICTION, with a bent toward SEXY GAY BOY SCENES. You suspect, however, that because of your ROMANTIC INEXPERIENCE that your sexy scenes are MAYBE NOT VERY AUTHENTIC.

Even though you are NOT THE BIGGEST GAMER, you still find yourself spending PREPOSTEROUS AMOUNTS OF TIME on your favorite genre, ROLEPLAYING VIDEO GAMES. You have a soft spot for IMMERSIVE STORIES even though occasionally those stories are KIND OF TERRIBLE.

You diligently practice the OBOE at the behest of your Nanna, but you would rather be spending that time curating your COLLECTION OF PRETTY ROCKS and MAKING JEWELRY.

You are also quite taken with several INDIE POP BANDS that one of your friends suggested awhile back that you might enjoy.

&gt; [[That&#x27;s quite enough of that.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="That&#x27;s quite enough of that." tags="" position="250,350">Don&#x27;t you want some context? You can&#x27;t just jump right into this story without a real idea of who you&#x27;re supposed to be.

Aren&#x27;t you interested in your adventures ONLINE ROLEPLAYING as [[Dean Winchester]]? Or your ORIGINAL ROMANTIC FICTION about Sebastian and William? What about the COLLAGE OF AVATAR FANART on your bedroom walls? Your replica of CEDRIC DIGGORY&#x27;S WAND?

&gt; [[Just stop with the capital letters.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Just stop with the capital letters." tags="" position="250,500">Oh, all right.

It will help you to know that you are playing a game called [[SPan]], and within it you have the title of [[Sylph of Time]].

You mostly have been using your powers for pointless shenanigans and easing the grind for [[your friends and co-players-&gt;Your Friends]].

DOOMING AN INFINITE SEA OF INCREMENTALLY LESS FUCKING ASTRONOMICALLY RETARDED TIMEKIDS TO BE EMBARRASSED IN DREAM BUBBLES FOR FUCKING EVER

NOT EVEN LIFE BESIDES OUR OWN AND WHAT WE HAVE IN THE FUCKING WRECKED METEOR

Really one in particular, who insists that he&#x27;s named Sesili. Except that instead of sounding like &quot;Cecily&quot; he wants you to pronounce it &quot;seh-SEE-lee.&quot;

For awhile, you just tried to ignore all of his weird bullshit messages. But now that you&#x27;ve entered this SPan game thing, he&#x27;s been progressively more helpful.

They seem to call themselves &quot;trolls,&quot; which you thought was just an Internet thing, but no.

It&#x27;s slowly turning out that pretty much everything that you thought was just an Internet thing is actually a real thing.

&gt; [[All of your friends have been talking to these aliens, too.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="All of your friends have been talking to these aliens, too." tags="" position="250,950">Hazel told you told that Nhamni was deeply into fanfiction, and so you wrote her a drabble. This is of course the multiversally recognized olive branch of fangirls everywhere.

Travis made you aware of this alien named Chehro, but he didn&#x27;t seem to pay him any attention at all.

&quot;Khetus is a sweetie,&quot; Olivia told you. You&#x27;d tried to express your dubiousness here, but she was insistent.

Zekras had sent Ethan some nude photos of herself, but he just went ahead and deleted them. That boy is just literally the gayest. You&#x27;ve decided that you&#x27;re going to make him do a one-boy Pride Parade whenever he finally comes out of the closet.

And Ransha was just hard to ignore, to be honest. Seriously, she is just the shoutiest.

JUST AS IT IS FACT THAT HAZEL NEVER GETS ANY ZILLIUM GRIST DESPITE ALL HER ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CLOWN MONSTERS

AND THAT SHE TOOK LIAM&#x27;S ARTIFICIAL INTEREST IN OLIVIA WITH HER WITCHING WAYS AND IS SO FUCKING STUPID SHE DIDN&#x27;T EVEN NOTICE

LIKE SHE DID THAT AND TWO HOURS LATER SHE TALKS TO OLIVIA ALONE FOR 60 FUCKING SECONDS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HER HUMOUR PUMPULATOR IS BEATING OUT OF HER CHEST, HER TONGUE FLOPPING OUT LIKE ONE OF YOUR CARTOON RAPIST SKUNKS

AWOOOOOOOOOOGA&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [[Now that is some fucking bullshit.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Now that is some fucking bullshit." tags="" position="250,1250">Your feelings on this are very complicated.

Two days ago, by the reckoning of normal time in the Medium, which is never the same as your own personal time:

Hazel just came right out and told you that she liked you. Not just as a friend, but that she like-liked you.

This was not a surprise.

Fortunately, you were at this moment saved by another version of yourself, who claimed to have come from a timeline in which dating Hazel went horribly wrong.

You and Hazel have always had a strong rapport. She was always cooler and richer and, well, bigger than you, in a lot of ways. She thought bigger than you. She wasn&#x27;t restrained by anything. It&#x27;s the thing you find most charming about her.

But when she started suggesting that your character avatars in the dumb self-insertion comics you and she made together might maybe start flirting... that had definitely been an indicator.

The surprise was that she mentioned it in the first place. You were fairly content to persist in having an awkward, emotionally-sensitive relationship.

That&#x27;s totally a thing, right?

&gt; [[The same kind of relationship you have with your best friend.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="The same kind of relationship you have with your best friend." tags="" position="250,1400">Olivia has been your BFF ever since your chance meeting on the Final Fantasy XI roleplay servers. She&#x27;s bubbly, and curiously charming, and always eager to push you into something you&#x27;re not really comfortable doing, but which you later decide you like anyway.

That&#x27;s a Best Friend thing. Knowing that you&#x27;re going to like something even when you don&#x27;t realize it.

You&#x27;re just okay with the ponies, though.

&gt; [[Then Liam pulled some shit.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Then Liam pulled some shit." tags="" position="250,1550">Somehow he got it into his head that it was a good idea to set up a speed-dating event on [[LoGMaR]] involving all of your friends and a bunch of weasels.

You don&#x27;t even want to get into it. It&#x27;s tiresome to even think about.

But you were not expecting a doomed alternate timeline version of yourself to appear and confess her love to Olivia.

(Confess, really? What a Hazel expression.)

You were even further not expecting that Olivia and Hazel would discover an interest in each other.

And that you would have difficult-to-explain feelings about it.

&gt; [[You needed to talk to Travis about it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="You needed to talk to Travis about it." tags="" position="400,50">During the speed-dating conversation you had, you felt like you and he really began to understand each other.

You&#x27;d sort of had weird feelings about him for a long while. An all-American boy overseas, lonely and looking for friends? It was hard not to feel like you and he had a connection there.

You sent each other mixtapes of music that you liked. He introduced you to Florence + the Machine. Not really his thing, he pointed out, but he was pretty sure that you would like it.

The thing is.

&gt; [[You have a problem with only noticing your crushes once they&#x27;re over.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="You have a problem with only noticing your crushes once they&#x27;re over." tags="" position="400,200">You hadn&#x27;t really met any of your friends in real life, until you met up in this game.

Real life? Such a strange phrase for what you&#x27;d all been doing together so far — killing monsters and doing quests in a game. But here it was.

You&#x27;d always known Travis to be an easygoing kind of dude, so you didn&#x27;t quite expect that having his house mildly wrecked would make him so...

//Enraged.//

It scared you.

And then he made a quote-unquote-joke about Olivia&#x27;s, uh, boobs. It wasn&#x27;t funny, and you found yourself forced to stand up for your best friend.

And just like that, you realized that all the things that you found roguishly fascinating about Travis had evaporated.

Like finding out how a magician does his trick. //Hey presto.//

&gt; [[But you&#x27;d be pretty happy just being good friends.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="But you&#x27;d be pretty happy just being good friends." tags="" position="400,350">You&#x27;re having a lot of feelings about this whole game, and about the things you&#x27;re figuring out about yourself.

And you don&#x27;t expect Olivia to be very helpful in talking about it.

But fortunately, you&#x27;ve got Travis. He sent you an email about having a nice chat. You&#x27;re looking forward to talking to him.

&gt; [[This other email, though.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="This other email, though." tags="" position="400,500">As weird as it is, you&#x27;re really excited for Olivia and Hazel.

It&#x27;s complicated.

The thing is.

They&#x27;re still your friends, and you want them to be happy.

You feel like you should be really excited for Olivia and Hazel.

So it fills you with a tremendous amount of anger that this fucking alien girl has decided to fuck with your friends&#x27; budding romance.

&gt; [[You decide to consult with Hazel.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="You decide to consult with Hazel." tags="" position="400,650">&lt;div class=&quot;im-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;im-handle-text&quot;&gt;CassandraMoon:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text&quot;&gt;okay i&#x27;m gonna tell ransha off&lt;/span&gt;

&gt; [[Goddamn it, Hazel.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Goddamn it, Hazel." tags="" position="400,800">Fuck it, you&#x27;re just going to send a message to Ransha alone.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text&quot;&gt;okay so

hazel has been yelling at me to stop clogging up her stupid fucking planning emails with my bullshit apparently so i am just going to say to you

stop messing with my fucking friends.

ethan is my friend, travis is my friend, olivia is my best friend, liam is my friend even though he is sometimes a creepster, and hazel is my friend even though sometimes she is one of the most trying people i fucking know

i don&#x27;t care if you insult me or tell me that i&#x27;m a clitterchitter or whatever it is you have going on in your weird fucking dictionary

that part is just fucking fine

but the part where my best friends just had a nice date for a couple of fucking hours and thought that maybe they might like each other, and you decided you wanted to go ahead and tell them that it was all just some misdirection and their feelings aren&#x27;t even real because of your fucking fourth-wall conjecture that they got caught up in their own stupid game powers is just

too

fucking

much.

so you want us to get you out of your cage of a fucking universe? you&#x27;re going to need us. and if you want anything out of us then you had better make goddamn fucking friends of us, or else i don&#x27;t see any reason why we need to bail you out of YOUR OWN FUCKING FAILURE AS A LEADER.

cross me and my friends, and i will tear down paradox space to shreds just to find your universe, burn it down, roll the ashes up into a tidy cigarillo, and daintily but deeply insert its smoldering wreckage between your buttcheeks.

make nice with us, and you have someone who maybe can push the alpha timeline into getting the both of us out of this fucking mess.

it&#x27;s up to you.

It&#x27;s taking a bit more work than you thought, though.

You&#x27;re laying low in a Pandasson hotel in [[LoCaF]] to get the fuzz off of your back. The amount of horrible puns in this game is frustrating you, a bit. You kind of can&#x27;t stand them, even though you know Ethan just revels in terrible dad jokes.

you taint that with lies and the whole thing is a fucking shambles

don&#x27;t you get it?

you have to feel like the lie you came up with about how you realized your feelings is a lie of your own making

so just shut the fuck up about it to hazel and olivia

and let them have their fucking moment together or whatever

you are pretty glib for someone who&#x27;s supposed to rely on us for both ends of your existence you know

i mean seriously olivia just got dumped because liam decided he only liked boys or something

which i thought was because he stole the smexy boy-boy interest from me when he was messing with the soul of future alternate me

but apparently not

the point is i would rather olivia&#x27;s fragile emotional state not be too fucked up

okay?

here i will pick out another insult: ovijaculatrix

don&#x27;t fuck it up you ovijaculatrix

how&#x27;s that?

also shut the fuck up about my fucking meltdown, i just want my friends to have an okay fucking time at the end of the world, okay

okay now to more important things meaning supernatural

so hang on this matespritship thing is supposed to be like romance? because that sounds like you are into the wincest which is, ugh

that ship has sailed long ago ransha

dean and castiel are anchored in my bay; it is just sooooooooo nearly canon, esp because the showrunners seriously had dean tell castiel i love you in the script in season 8 before they changed it

come on though the show has girls in it

charlie is okay; i wish she weren&#x27;t such a mary sue

sesili seems very convinced that we are going to make your universe

i mean i don&#x27;t know what your universe is like but foe yay sure seems like a big thing there

i guess there must also be a lot of, i don&#x27;t know, space marines and physics and gay porn and swords

if we both need each other then that is paradox space setting some kind of fucking cosmic irony, but it seems to be pretty fucking good at that so far

you sure seem to have a lot of faith in us ransha

pretty sure that is misplaced

IS THERE ANYTHING MORE JUVENILE AND SILLY THAN THROWING AWAY A QUINTADE LONG MATESPRITSHIP BECAUSE SOME NEW CHUMP MAKES SMOLDERING BUCKET EYES AT YOU? YOU SUBMIT THAT THERE IS NOT

SAM AND THE DEAN HAVE THE CRUSHING WEIGHT OF A BEAUTIFUL, COMPLEX AND TORTUROUS MATESPRITSHIP, CARRYING THEM AND EACH OTHER FORWARD LIKE THE INESCAPABLE DRIVE OF A 500 BOX TRACKROLLER. MATURE RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THEIRS LOSE SOME OF THE TRAPPINGS OF JUVENILE FIXATION- THEY NO LONGER SMOLDER WITH UNREQUITED PASSION BECAUSE THEIR PASSION HAS BEEN COMFORTABLY REQUITED FOR 5 FUCKING SWEEPS. LIKE A LEGENDARY FLUSHED CONCUPISCIESCENCE SHOULD, THEY HAVE AT MANY POINTS CARRIED THEIR RELATIONSHIP FORWARD THROUGH THE AID OF MANY AUSPISTICILIATRICES, BOTH WELL MEANING, LIKE THAT MAJESTIC AUSPILIATRON BOBBY WHO CAN, DESPITE HIS REPULSIVE COLORING AND LACK OF HORNS, OCCUPY MY ASHCILIATORY QUADRANT ANYTIME, AND OTHERS LIKE CASTIEL AND THAT DUMB ANNA BITCH EMPTILY PAWING AT THE GREATNESS OF THEIR LOVE, LIKE PALE HIDEPECKERS GRUBBING ALL THEY CAN FROM THE INDIFFERENT MUSCLEHORN. REAL LOVE IS HARD WORK, NOT EASY GLANCES OVER A HAMBURGER BRIBE
OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR EPIC QUINTADE TOGETHER THEY HAVE WAXED BLACK AND RED AND BEEN TORN ASUNDER BUT THEY GET BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE FOR THEM THE NAME OF ETERNAL LOVE IS &quot;HE&#x27;S MY BROTHER&quot;

THEY HAVE LITERALLY SAVED AND DOOMED THE WORLD FOR EACH OTHER, RAISED EACH OTHER FROM THE DEAD, SOLD THEIR SOULS AND SACRIFICED THEIR FRIENDS AND A DIFFERENT BROTHER

A GREATER TESTAMENT TO THE SAGA OF THEIR LOVE COULD NOT EXIST

EXCEPT ANOTHER SEASON, WHERE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SPEND THEIR LIVES TOGETHER

WHILST CASTIEL WILL JUST PASS IN AND OUT, AS HE ALWAYS HAS

BASKING IN THE HEAT, BUT UNABLE TO FULLY ACCEPT IT

IRONICALLY, HE IS THE MOST HUMAN OF THEM ALL





IT&#x27;S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU YEARN FOR FORBIDDEN LOVE

ALL YOUR LOVE SEEMS TO BE FUCKING FORBIDDEN. ALL I SEE IS WEIRD FUCKING TABOO SHIT EVERYWHERE

THE BIZARRE HUMAN ANATHEMA OF &quot;INCEST&quot;

THE EVEN WEIRDER TABOO ON BOYS DOING IT TOGETHER

WHY DOES YOUR CULTURE LOVE GIRLS DOING IT BUT NOT BOYS I DON&#x27;T FUCKING GET IT

AND WHY IS IT THAT YOUR CULTURE LIKES GIRLS DOING IT BUT ONLY REALLY LIKES BOY/GIRL COUPLES MAKING A REAL GO OF IT

IT&#x27;S LIKE YOUR WHOLE SPECIES IS TRYING NOT TO FUCKING DO IT

AND BY DO IT, I MEAN CONQUER THE GRODDAMN UNIVERSE WITH WICKED ARMIES

IT&#x27;S LIKE YOUR SPECIES KNOWS HOW MUCH IT SUCKS AND IS EMBARASSED TO SPREAD




WE CODDLE NO SUCH FUCKING WEAKNESS ON ALTERNIA. YOU GET YOUR SHIT IN ORDER, KNOW WHO YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO FILL A FILIAL PAIL WITH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE IMPERIAL DRONE WILL COME A&#x27;KNOCKING AND YOUR LUSUS CAN&#x27;T FUCKING SAVE YOU THEN


ALSO, AN OVIJACULATRIX IS A THING

IT&#x27;S A PINKFEATHERBEAST WITH NO FEATHERS
ITS REPRODUCTIVE AND DIGESTIVE TRACTS ARE ONE LONG TOGETHER THING, AND IT CAN SPIT THESE FUCKING EGGS 
THE SHELLS ARE LIKE A GODDAMN INCH AND A HALF THICK AND THEY CAN CRACK STONE AND SHATTER BONE

THEY MAKE A PRETTY GOOD LUSUS FOR A MUTANT CANDYBLOOD&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [[Quadruple ugh.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Quadruple ugh." tags="" position="550,950">You&#x27;re certain that Ransha picked this exact point in your timeline to wax philosophical about the nature of forbidden love in order to annoy you.

She also clearly does not understand the source of your love for Destiel.

This must be corrected.

It&#x27;ll at least give you something else to think about.

Subject: Re: the line

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text&quot;&gt;oh ransha, how can you not see it

the reason why i don&#x27;t ship wincest isn&#x27;t just because of the cherry-topped-whipped-cream-on-your-sundae that is the notion of jensen ackles and misha collins snogging

it&#x27;s also because sam is a TERRIBLE brother

point: when sam dies, dean sells his soul to the crossroads demon to resurrect him; then next season, sam just watches his own brother get eaten by hellhounds and fucks around for four months with some girl not doing anything! and who saves him? answer: CASTIEL.

point: dean kills dick roman aka naked snake and gets stuck in purgatory and sam goes and fucks around again for a whole year with some other girl, and dean has to con his way out with a vampire; and why does dean start torturing people again while in purgatory? answer: CASTIEL.

point: dean hands over the keys to sam for the first time and sam immediately destroys BABY, DEAN&#x27;S FIRST MATESPRIT

or whatever the fuck it is you are calling it

so yeah, dean needs sam way more than sam needs him, and sam is a whiny selfish bitch who doesn&#x27;t deserve his love.

and then comes castiel

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nAGpEvzpRc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dean&#x27;s angel&lt;/a&gt;

so i will request that you put any youthful fanfic-based wincest indiscretions of mine from previous seasons aside

because how can the hand of that angel on dean&#x27;s back means anything but &lt;3.

...for real though you are into bobby? i didn&#x27;t even know that was a thing

not that i really know what an ashciliatory quadrant is supposed to be

unless it&#x27;s some bodily crevice you guys have somewhere

not that i even really know what trolls look like i guess, for all i know you look like a tiger riding around in a dalek or something

...

...anyway don&#x27;t ask me why nobody likes boys doing it, i am totally fine with it obvs

i mean who can object to the undeniable chemistry between jack sparrow and will turner for example

humans are all up into some baby action though, that&#x27;s why everyone likes the straight pairings in rl

it&#x27;s because babies, which need mom parts and dad parts to hook up

okay now you are thinking that you are going to tell me something about ectobiology so shut up, that is not a thing on earth.

god your species&#x27; romantic comedies must be like five minutes long if you are all so amazingly prepared to rub your clitterchitters all up on each other

i am imagining troll harry met troll sally

or troll love actually

or 10 things i hate about you

anyway i&#x27;m glad YOU have all your shit in order and you&#x27;re ready to uh, fill up your filial pail

with whatever you fill that up with

i guess you probably saw my stupid-ass argument with travis.

i&#x27;m still getting this whole girls-doing-it thing in order, that has mostly been hazel&#x27;s whole deal

which i guess i should have figured out because of her whole femslash weeaboo whatever thing

i have no map for this; i mean am i supposed to start off reading ginmione fic here? i don&#x27;t even know

whatever, the important thing is

humans are pretty bad at taking over the universe with our wicked fucking armies

but we are pretty good at awesome stories, you caterfister.

SAM DOESN&#x27;T DESERVE DEAN

OF COURSE, CASTIEL KEEPS KICKING THE EVER LIVING GRUBSAUCE OUT OF DEAN SO MAYBE HE DOESN&#x27;T DESERVE HIM EITHER

BASICALLY THE ONLY MATESPRIT FOR DEAN IS CHARLIE THEN, BUT THAT&#x27;S A TOUGH BRIDGE FOR HER

IT&#x27;S HARD TO GET OUT OF THE MOIRAIL ZONE

GOOD THING HE HAS THAT KISMESIS THING LOCKED UP

TOO BAD LUCIFER IS GONE

YOUR ASHCILIATORY QUADRANT, HYPOTHETICALLY SINCE YOU&#x27;RE SOME WEIRD FUCKING CREATURE THAT ONLY HAS MATESPRITSHIP, IS A PLACE FOR A NON-CONCUPISCIENT ROMANCE

SO LIKE
A FATED SOUL MENTOR
AND YOU LOOKED FOR THE PERFECT ONE THE SAME WAY YOU LOOK FOR YOUR &quot;TRUE LOVE&quot;

AND THEN THEY WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR SHIT BUT ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR ROMANCE SHIT WHEN IT GOES AWRY

LIKE BOBBY IS ALWAYS DOING WITH SAM AND DEAN

AND A LOT OF TIME IT&#x27;S A PLACE PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN WHEN THEY&#x27;RE TRYING TO GET IN ON THE ACTION WITH ONE OR SOMETIMES BOTH PEOPLE IN CONCUPISCIENT RELATIONSHIPS (MATESPRITSHIP OR KISMESIS)

LIKE CASTIEL

I&#x27;M NOT NORMALLY INTO ROMANTIC COMEDIES
BUT
THEY HAVE 4 QUADRANTS SO THEY&#x27;RE A LOT LONGER THAN YOUR AS A GENERAL RULE
AND FOR FUCK&#x27;S SAKE THE TITLES ARE TOO LONG, NOT THAT WE EVER READ THEM ANYWAYS
WE JUST WATCHED THE TRAILERS

SESILI SAYS THAT THERE&#x27;S A SORT OF LANGUAGE IN THEM
I TOLD HIM OF COURSE THERE IS THERE&#x27;S WORDS, FUCKING RETARD

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text&quot;&gt;okay i will concede to you

jensen ackles and jared padalecki together are totally hot.

and is totally what i thought starting off

but sam sort of reached peak smexy around season 3 and tapered off around there

once you reach season 6 the nation of sam winchester is exporting perilously low quantities of barrels of smexy

it&#x27;s the hair. why jared, why

charlie and dean? nonononono

charlie is only into the girls; also she is innocent and pure as the driven snow which is why we never see her get any girls ever

plus if she did that would be like a whole other show

i will give you sam and lucifer though

lucifer has just the right amount of beard

i mean it&#x27;s a little awkward to do make-outs with the dude you&#x27;re about to become, but it&#x27;s sort of

the right amount of awkward also.

...anyway

why would you hate pirates?

sailing the high seas all yohoho and three sheets to the wind and puffy shirts

pirates are great; butt pirates doubly so.

if you like pirates you should check out the dread pirate roberts

tooooootally hot

that cracking wit

and his sexy accent

for that accent i will forgive many things including the fact that his mustache is obviously penciled in.

you even get two accents if you go all the way with westley/inigo

also: a farm boy and a pirate, how can you beat that

not that i really get your farmer thing

seriously though name a sexy farmer, i can&#x27;t name one other sexy farmer

luke skywalker is the unsexiest and he just farms fucking moisture.

i am starting to get the picture on this whole troll romance situation and it is too weird

you are telling me that you are supposed to hook up with like four other trolls?

that&#x27;s like soooo much effort, it&#x27;s hard enough to just find even one person you like who likes you back

how do you even get a house together, do trolls live in the biggest poly commune ever basically

so everyone can have easy naked access to all of their boinkable vexascinated heartthrobs in their big love matrix?

i can&#x27;t ever figure out sesili&#x27;s deal

he&#x27;s been all douchey to me for like a million fucking years but now he keeps sending me all this helpful info

it&#x27;s like, that is some wicked mood whiplash there.

waiting with baited breath for you to tell me about how soraya is someone he lost in his emo backstory

oh please, tell me there is an emo backstory

anyway speaking of that, i guess you hate us all so

i&#x27;m sure you are awaiting our allegedly predestined meeting with alternate feelings of spite and disdain

i&#x27;m just excited that i get to see a tiger riding around in a dalek for the first time.

ONLY INTO GIRLS

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

SHE CLEARLY HAS THE MOIRALLIANCE WITH DEAN

MOIRALLIANCE IS BASICALLY A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF MATESPRITSHIP

I AM SUPPOSED TO HATE PIRATES BECAUSE IT TYPICALLY MEANS PITIFUL LAND DWELLERS FUCKING SHIT UP OUT ON MY WATERS

OR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY WATERS

OR... WELL, IT&#x27;S A WHOLE THING

THEY WEREN&#x27;T MY WATERS
AND THEY ARE OUT THERE OWNING IT EVEN THOUGH THEY DON&#x27;T OWN IT, THE CONDESCE DOES

WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO UNTIL THEY WERE MY WATERS

INSTEAD I HAD TO HIDE IN A FUCKING CAVE AND COLLECT SCRAPS

SO I BOTH LOVE AND HATE THOSE WHO WOULD DO CRIMES ON MY WATERS

SORAYA WAS ONE OF OUR PLAYERS

REAL FUCKING WEIRDO, THAT CHICK

SHE FUCKING LOVED SPIES AND TRAPS

JEGUS ALL THE TRAPS SHE FUCKING TRAPPED EVERYTHING

ALWAYS DRESSING UP IN SLINKY LITTLE DRESSES OR DASHING SUITS

AND SHE FUCKING LOVED TO BE TRAPPED TOO SHE WAS ALWAYS &quot;ACCIDENTALLY&quot; ARRANGING FOR WHATEVER FUCKING CRUSH SHE HAD AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER TO FIND HER ALL STRUNG UP WITH A FUCKING BUZZSAW SLOWLY SPINNING TOWARDS HER

SHE GOT MOST OF US ON ONE END OR THE OTHER AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER

ANYWAYS THERE&#x27;S NO EMO BACKSTORY REALLY

I THINK SHE AND SESILI HAD A BLACKROM THING GOING ON BUT WHATEVER

ANYWAYS SHE WENT MISSING

I ALWAYS ASSUMED ONE OF HER FUCKING TRAPS GOT HER

OR MAYBE SESILI JUST FUCKING RAN ACROSS HER AND MADE SURE THE TRAP FINISHED THE JOB

SHE WAS SUPER FUCKING ANNOYING

ARE YOU A TARD

FARMERS ARE INHERENTLY SEXY

ALL WORKING SOIL AND DIRTY SHIT ALL SERVILE LIKE

ARE YOU CRAZY

THATS NOT WISE

WE GET STRONGER AND LESS... STABLE FOR THE MOST PART AS WE GET OLDER
A REALLY STRONG MOIRAILDOM OR MATESPRITSHIP DOES IT SOMETIMES, BUT IT&#x27;S USUALLY A BAD IDEA

NO FUCKING WAY WOULD YOU LIVE WITH YOUR KISMESIS UNLESS YOU HAD THE FUCKING GREATEST AUSPISTICE OF ALL TIME

THERE ARE MOVIES LIKE THAT, THOUGH AND THEY&#x27;RE NOT REALLY MY THING BUT SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY HOT

USUALLY INVOLVING SOME SORT OF PRISON


WE DON&#x27;T LOOK LIKE TIGERS IN GARBAGE CANS

WE LOOK KINDA LIKE YOU BUT MORE AWESOME IN EVERY WAY

WELL, I DO ANYWAYS THE REST OF THESE CHUMPS, EXCEPT FUCKING NHAMNI, ARE PRETTY FUCKING GOOFY LOOKING
BUT STILL YOU LOOK STUPID WITH YOUR PINKISH BROWNISH SKINS AND YOUR LACK OF HORNS AND YOUR ROUND RUSTBLOOD TEETH

OR I GUESS I SHOULD SAY CANDYBLOOD TEETH 

CHEHRO HAS THE SAME COLOR BLOOD AS YOU, WHICH IS A THING I DON&#x27;T WANT TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text&quot;&gt;uh okay, so ransha

in the interest of cross-cultural communication

when i say that charlie is only into girls, it means that uh

well

okay explaining this is embarrassing

pretty much she needs another girl to get her her filial pail juices going

because boys make her, uh, bucketspout dry up like a raisin in the sun.

the point is charlie lives in femslash territory

not that there is anyone to slash her with in the show that i can even think of to be honest

god i guess i need to get some femslash to read now.

for uh research reasons

but i don&#x27;t want to ask hazel for a list, that is just fucking awkward.

sigh

anyway i figure the condesce is supposed to be some ocean king or something

and you are supposed to be the inheritor or something

like troll ariel.

so tell me all about your mysterious cave

are there dinglehoppers and banded bulbous snarfblatts?

and piles upon piles of printouts of pirate/farmer fanfics?

btw i am always partial to a taut and muscled figure with additional vocal twang

but you gotta have the brain to match the looks in my book

which is why dean winchester had me at snark one

friggin&#x27; velvety smooth.

seriously though you&#x27;re telling me that troll romance is just like

all long-distance relationships all the time with occasional bouts of make-outs

and if trolls live together it is MASS HYSTERIA

how are you supposed to support mpreg fanfic if your culture doesn&#x27;t have adorable cohabitation scenes

i mean some humans do the poly thing but a lot of times they get a big house together if they can

i heard that poly gets mega-expensive though because you have to do a lot of first dates.

anyway i thought there were only supposed to be six of you guys, i&#x27;ve never heard of this soraya chick

unless you had a bunch more people in your session who died or something

like the ones who died in the session of those other dicks

i guess candyblood is supposed to mean human blood?

maybe chehro is half-human or something, i bet he would be all pissed off if i called him that

man i thought you guys were going to be mega-alien, i wasn&#x27;t expecting like

horny humanoids with a bucket preoccupation

speaking of which i keep hearing that you and nhamni have a thing

a thing that i assume is why you&#x27;re thinking she&#x27;s not so goofy-looking

Then Carver did his little speed-dating quest event, and you and Olivia realized that you had a lot more in common than you thought, besides just being friends with Tara.

Good job, guy. Now you&#x27;ve got yourself two thirteen-year-old girls about to fling themselves out of their universe.

What are you supposed to even do with this?

&gt; (link: &quot;Narrator: Zoom out.&quot;)[(set: $name to 0)(goto: &quot;Narrator: Zoom out.&quot;)](if: false)[ [[Narrator: Zoom out.]] ]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Narrator: Zoom out." tags="dark" position="900,200">At the very lip of the Furthest Ring, surrounded by asteroids the size of cities and states — some not particularly far from the size of the Moon — two Asian girls look beyond all that they know to still exist at infinite blackness.

It&#x27;s darker than anything. Looking in its direction with eyes open fills the girls&#x27; heads with a susurrating fear that they have been struck entirely blind. For Hazel, she can &quot;see&quot; the very edge, but a step&#x27;s worth of distance away, but she still feels an ominous sense of forboding.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Tara can&#x27;t feel the edge.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Tara can&#x27;t feel the edge." tags="dark" position="900,350">Tara can&#x27;t feel the edge. As far as she can see, this is the end of all that is. But upon gazing out, she... thinks there is something out there — something familiar, and both comforting and smothering. Alien and yet so familiar, it&#x27;s like family.

She briefly considers Harry Potter&#x27;s constant encounters with the shades of all he longs for — living paintings of his parents, the shade of Sirius Black.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Hazel pushes you both forward.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Hazel pushes you both forward." tags="dark" position="900,500">Hazel is completely lost the second she crosses the border. Left without a sense at all, she seems to be entirely alone. She is neither cold nor warm, up nor down, and the only sense she has is the sounds of her own immortal body slowly carrying forth its divine metabiology.

//thump thump//

//thump thump//

Hazel is panicked. A desperate push with her powers gives her a barest scrap of space underneath her, but it goes nowhere and avails her not. The distraction is comforting, however.

She pushes the fabric back to where she believes she entered the void... but there is no relationship between space and not space here.

She pushes the space out into a thin line, and travels along it until it reaches the end. It will stretch no further, and she then travels back along its length and turns it. It refuses to turn much, but through this rocking, back and forth on a paper-thin line of wobbling, unstraight space, Hazel finds a lone, straggling path that will take her back into the session.

You are Tara Tan, and you feel the sensation of being swept up into sudden tangibility.

The darkness resolves into a scene around you, and you&#x27;re filled with inexorable contextual knowledge:

Hazel stands on [[LoGMaR]], feverishly pecking out a nasty message to Ransha.

It seems that Nhamni called Hazel fat, and that Hazel didn&#x27;t like it, and that Ransha doubled down and has been calling Hazel fat even as Nhamni said it was just a figure of speech and that you look like &quot;roundtootheD doofmonsterS.&quot;

Hazel&#x27;s response is to insult Ransha&#x27;s leadership, which Ransha defends passionately.

Ransha&#x27;s response is to insult Hazel&#x27;s competence, highlighting an incident with a treasured cinderemnant receptacle.

Hazel&#x27;s response is a threat to trolls.

Nhamni pipes back in, condescendingly reminding Hazel that her level is &quot;nothinG shorT oF goDhooD.&quot;

Ransha states that even godhood isn&#x27;t enough to kill her.

Sesili regretfully concurs with Ransha.

Nhamni expresses a confidence-based doubt of Ransha&#x27;s claims.

Chehro impugns the very notion of the God Tier.

Nhamni says that he&#x27;s just &quot;feelinG thE covetbrutE.&quot;

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Chehro tells Nhamni]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Dark" tags="" position="51,946">{&lt;script&gt;

Hazel, whose pupils are not showing for some reason, is lying on her Quest Bed sending more messages.

Simone appears, throws her off the bed, and kills her by bashing her hand though Hazel&#x27;s chest and crushing her beating heart while Hazel chops right through her without touching her.

Doomed!Hazel lays there, for a while.

A single, unbroken loop of straw-colored papyrus is tucked into the mercurial feed roll.

You use it to travel through time by typing about the scene where you want to be, then spinning the cylinder knob toward you to travel into the past.

It&#x27;s incredibly silly, but what isn&#x27;t, at this point?

You&#x27;ve tried spinning the knob away from yourself to travel into the future, but this hasn&#x27;t worked very well for you yet. But you can&#x27;t help feeling like it&#x27;s something you ought to be able to do, if you just had the sense for it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Tara: Kiss Hazel to revive her." tags="dark prompt" position="900,1100">You transition to Hazel&#x27;s golden bedroom on Prospit. She wakes up, your mouth on hers, explodes into a furious blush, and ever so slightly parts her lips.

You pull back.

An eye-shatteringly bright golden room lays before you, filled with the sorts of things your friend and admirer Hazel has sent to you. Two replicas of Inuyasha&#x27;s Tetsusaiga, in both sword and fang form. A wall scroll with a woodcut of her great-grandpa — seems like he was kind of a big deal. A volleyball, a copy of Mannequin, volumes of various shonen manga, that manga where King Arthur was secretly a pretty teenage girl, and a tablet computer: a high end Cintiq.

Hazel thanks you effusively, overly so, for saving her life. This Hazel, from further back in the timeline, has the fires of her ardor for Tara stoked to their absolute peak, and you have just thrown uranium into the fire.

If that makes sense.

It doesn&#x27;t, but okay. 

Doomed!Hazel regards you with poorly-concealed adoration.

You are uncomfortable with the amount of attention you are getting; it is as though the sun is shining on you and only you.

And the empty white eyes are NOT helping.

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Tara thank you soooooo much. I knew it would be you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{

It seems that this is taking place not far from when Hazel really started getting antsy about the God Tier, so there are shenanigans afoot everywhere.

This is right before you went to [[LoLaS]] to help Zagreb. Liam is spending a lot of time mad-sciencing, Travis is being standoffish and shitty with everyone, Olivia is mooning over Liam, Ethan is making grossly hilarious shit with the [[Alchemiter]].

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Is this one of your drug dealing loops? Where&#x27;s the Iconic Bassist&#x27;s Wear?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Hazel asks, referring to the Keith Richards getup you wore through one of your money-laundering runs.{

I&#x27;m going to go put it on my quest bed now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She whisks the two of you over to her Quest Bed, but when you arrive, the body is gone.

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Hazel intones lowly. She immediately tries to scry its location, but to the surprise of no one, she can&#x27;t seem to find it.

Out here, the further you get away from Hazel, things seem to have less detail, less substance.

It&#x27;s almost romantic.

She&#x27;s torn between watching you and getting back to her adventure, as you step out into the incresasingly dreamlike and insubstantial woods. Your hand alights on a very long black fiber of some sort. You begin to examine the curiosity as the scene changes around you.

You find yourself on the outside of a castle on what you presume to be [[LoCaB]].

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Hazel is up on the battlements]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="LoGMaR" tags="info" position="50,1550">The Land of Grunge Music and Rain.

There is a massive chasm here, and you reflect on how much you may have missed out on by never doing a quest here.

There is a commotion at the keep, where apparently MC Croco is addressing the Beta Kids?

You are attacked suddenly from the cover of darkness, but as you reel from the wound in your side, you lay eyes on what could only be Ransha and snort reflexively.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;The first thing that strikes you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Tara: Ow, fuck." tags="dark" position="1100,650">&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;ow, fuck,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hear yourself shout. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;what the fuck, ransha?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&quot;HAHAHAHA&quot; Ransha laughs, peals of musical laughter springing joyously from her bright fuschia lips. It&#x27;s difficult to reconcile the pain in your side, your frustration, and the cherubic ruffian that you see.

&quot;YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING WEAKLING OH MY GRODD&quot;

She is loud, but not as shouty as you previously suspected. She seems unable to keep song entirely from her voice, so even her normal talk leaves the unmistakable impression of... well, Mary Poppins?

You regard her with what you hope is your most withering gaze of condescension. 

&quot;THAT&#x27;S THE &#x27;DON&#x27;T FUCKING PUSH ME ON THE NHAMNI FRONT&#x27; GENTLE WARNING. I FUCKING HATE HER BUT I DON&#x27;T THINK SHE THINKS ABOUT ME AT ALL&quot;

She pauses for a moment of consideration, before the childlike Condesce seems ready to continue.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Tara: Listen to Ransha&#x27;s gesture of camaraderie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Tara: Get up stubbornly. Ow, fuck." tags="dark" position="1100,950">&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;i figured you didn&#x27;t kill me for totally impersonal predestined paradox reasons of needing me,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you say, struggling to get back on your feet. Ransha does not appear to make a move to help you.

&quot;TOUCHE&quot; She frowns ever so slightly. &quot;I WAS HOPING HAZEL WOULD BE HERE, I WANTED TO KILL HER&quot;

She looks at you in a way you assume is meant to generate cameraderie, but you don&#x27;t feel it on account of the //three gaping wounds in your fucking side//.

&quot;I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT. NOW I HAVE TO SETTLE FOR KILLING DREAM HAZEL OVER THERE.&quot;

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Tara: How the fuck are you even here anyway?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Tara: Crouch down furtively." tags="dark prompt" position="1250,350">You crouch down, matching Ransha&#x27;s stance. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;you&#x27;re asleep, but your dream self is dead,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you whisper urgently, &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;so that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; You pause, to consider this. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;i don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s with all the tactical espionage action.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&quot;THESE BUBBLES CONNECT ALL SORTS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT, TARA. I&#x27;M NOT IN ANY DANGER HERE EXCEPT TO MY DIGNITY, BECAUSE IF I GET KILLED I&#x27;LL JUST WAKE UP. YOU, ON THE OTHER WEBBED MANIPULATOR, ARE RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR REAL BODY. AND IF YOU GET KILLED HERE, WHO KNOWS IF A RELUCTANT SMOOCH FROM MY PROTEIN FLAPS WILL AWAKEN YOUR DREAM SELF.&quot;

The diminuitive despot waves you to follow her. &quot;COME ON&quot; she says, before pulling a ring from a pocket and putting it on.

Your [[Ray-B&amp;s]] tell you that it is an **Authentic Legion Flight Ring**.

While you&#x27;re doing that, you check out the rest of Ransha&#x27;s gear. Seems the trident is serious business — a **Threat of the Emperor&#x27;s 2x3dent**. She wears a short red jacket over a pink dress that seems awfully familiar — the **Cetacean Dreamer**, which is awful in pretty much every way except it gives a gargantuan bonus to **Wishful Thinking**, which you previously had not known was a stat.

She makes her way over to where Doomed!Hazel and Ethan were, and looks down at you expectantly.{

She hurls her trident at an unseen foe, shortly followed by an explosion of effervescent laughter. &quot;WAKE THE FUCK UP, SPACE CASE. YOU DED&quot;

Hazel begins looking at her hands, considering her mortality; you take the opportunity to slap one of those hands full of [[The Colt]].

You place a palm gently on Doomed!Hazel&#x27;s shoulder, locking with the eerie white eyes. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;i&#x27;m sorry hazel, i think you&#x27;re dead.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You&#x27;re so hurt right now, you know that if any enemy were to come, you would have nothing left to fight. Not that it would stop you from trying — you&#x27;re made of sterner stuff than that — but you know that you must consider yourself before anything else right now.

You decide to turn your neck, which is an odd thing in and of itself, you consider. Haven&#x27;t really done much of that in a while!

You save yourself the trouble of wondering where you are, though. You&#x27;re on [[LoCaB]], where you found the base of operations of the Beta Kids.

Ethan is dead. You clearly saw Ethan alive in the clouds.

No sign emerges.

You decide that you do, in fact, look pretty cool carrying the trident. It doesn&#x27;t really work with Ransha&#x27;s outfit, but if she strikes a wide-legged pose, it seems to work for her.

&quot;Let me tell you what real power is. Real power is taking a being&#x27;s life into your hands and molding it in a million seen and unseen ways until all that they are is a reflection of your desires. Real power is to hold the fate of trillions in your hands. 

&quot;You&#x27;ve lived in a tower, your whole life and at the moment you stretch your legs, you stretch your imagination and ego to suppose you have power? Let me tell you, Nhamni Inza — I, Hierarch Kavon, have known power.

You start to roll up the fiber as you beckon for Hazel&#x27;s attention, but you can&#x27;t seem to get it. She and Ethan whisper quietly as you make your way over to the stone wall.

You feel as though you are being watched, intently.

In the cutest possible way — despite her nearly objective beauty and recent dalliances with the notions of kissing girls, prurient thoughts are slower to come to mind than wondering what it would be like to dress her up.

Even her grunts of exertion are musical and pleasing to the ear. She looks, and sounds, like she fell out of an alien storybook. You called her Ariel in your email; you were even closer than you thought.

Grey-skinned and black-haired, she doesn&#x27;t break five feet tall even with her raised heels. She&#x27;s waifishly thin, with arms like little sticks, hair down to the back of her thighs, finlike protrusions on her neck, and webbing on her hands to the first knuckle, betraying her aquatic nature. She has two colorful, candy corn horns gently sweeping from the sides of her forehead that curl up like butterfly antennae.

Those break five feet.

You&#x27;re pretty sure that, if you count the horns, she&#x27;s slightly taller than you.

She snarls, revealing perfectly white teeth that seem to have a little zig-zag pattern on them until you realize that she has two rows of pointy little dagger teeth.

Okay, that&#x27;s not so pretty.

Ransha twirls her double-ended trident. Despite her petite size, she carries herself like a proficient warrior.{

Hazel is out where your keen, deerstalker cap-derived detective skills tell you she would have confronted Simone or some other Beta Kid — and now she has a fork in her.

She&#x27;s done.

You glare angrily at Ransha, despite knowing that she didn&#x27;t really kill your friend.

&quot;WAKEY WAKEY DIM AND SPACEY&quot;

Rage surges though you as the hidden mother bear within you surges to life. You begin to unleash the most Tara-esque possible diatribe to knock Ransha down a peg.

Shit. You need some more time to come up with some really good shit to say.

You see Doomed!Hazel prop herself up on one arm, utterly mystified as to why she could still be alive. Which is weird, because she doesn&#x27;t seem to remember what killed her at all.

You pivot from momentary speechlessness, gearing up to unleash a less articulate, more passionate outburst about Ransha&#x27;s nearly immeasurable shortcomings. The target of your acrimony attentively watches you, queueing up her own loud outburst as a defensive mechanism in response, when the finlike protrusion on her cheek twitches slightly and her head begins to turn.

It&#x27;s about this point that Ransha gets hit by an enormous rock.

The rock, about the size of a mail drop box, hits Ransha with bone-crushing force, immediately turning one arm into a stomach-churning, flailing hose of meat.

The rest of her conforms to the shape of the odd object, spinning wildly through the air before hitting the ground with a crunch and bouncing again, sending one perfectly-formed leg flying away from the rest of her. Her fuschia blood trails in a spiral from the crudely-severed end, while the large rock and the rest of her come to a rest in the corner of the wrecked allure, which I cannot believe is the word for that and yet it is.

You scan for the assailant but see no sign of one.

Her clothes are wrecked — she was wearing the **Battousai&#x27;s Wandering Days** for a set bonus with the **Sakabatou** — but for now, she just tugs things into a loose facsimile of decency and turns to face you.

Velvety-smooth yet very firm and insistent, the sensation is as immediately pleasant as it is //FUCKING NUTS WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT oh right hazel//.

You&#x27;re not sure what to do with this. This is starting to become a familiar, homey feeling.

Your mind races with the faculties of someone who can cheat and give themselves a little bit of extra time to think, but you&#x27;re interrupted by the poke of a trident underneath your chin.

&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ransha-text whisper&quot;&gt;SLF FX MUH&lt;/span&gt;&quot; a flapping mash of teeth blurts.

You apply the temporal magic to the already-knitting form, and the troll girl knits back together in a split-second as Doomed!Hazel kicks her hand off the far end of the trident. You feel Hazel&#x27;s hand linger on yours for a moment before she pulls it back sheepishly.

Diminutive and dainty like a porcelain doll, the grey-skinned girl locks eyes with the tall, amber-eyed girl.

Hazel and Ransha begin fighting almost instantly.

In a quick series of moves, you watch near-helplessly as Ransha trips the alternative princess, who recovers into a kip-up and kicks the fuck out of her assailant in a three-fold maneuver, knocking her off-balance, in the solar plexus, and then the chin. The alien girl responds by snapping her sharp, broken teeth onto your doomed friend&#x27;s retreating ankle, and delicately but savagely flips her over her shoulder into a craggy pile of rubble.

Your friend gasps as she succumbs to the work of gravity, and you&#x27;re startled to feel the force of Hazel&#x27;s impact reverberate through the disrepaired masonry under your feet.

In a flash, Hazel swings out a curiously-intact leg to ensnare Ransha, pulling her into a chokehold. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Go to sleep, Fish bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hear the Hafu heiress say.

It&#x27;s hard to watch as the fight degenerates from there, and you&#x27;re not really sure how you can help. Or even who you would help, really?

Your thoughts turn unbidden to what just happened as you lose track of the fight for a moment.

You had not really been expecting that all of your first experiences in this area were pretty much just going to be horribly awkward, and half-unwelcome, and //out of your control.//

You notice, for the first time, the deep, volcanic simmer of a long-brewing anger in yourself.

You snap to attention when you realize that Ransha has by now gotten Hazel on the ground, and is sitting atop her.

Typical Hazel.

The grey-skinned girl grabs an exhausted hand, twists it into something loosely resembling a fist, and winds up to hit Hazel with it.

You sigh, and step forward to kick Ransha in the head. //Reeeeeaaally hard.//

She tumbles away, dazed.

Doomed!Hazel sits up, suddenly not the slightest bit worse for wear. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be odd to her that she was nine-tenths dead before the fight even started, yet she was able to put in a decent showing against a murderous alien.

You extend a hand to the self-conscious samurai, pulling her to her feet. Hazel leans in awkwardly, obviously wanting to express her gratitude, but she pulls back at the last moment.

It&#x27;s some kind of game that has taken over your real world, which has deposited its six players into a pocket universe with a planet tailor-made for each of them, and granted each one mysterious powers. Completing the game involves creating some kind of frog that is also a universe, which you are supposed to mold in your image or something.

What //really// happens is that if you try to disrupt the timeline too much a future version of yourself comes back in time to stop you, so that&#x27;s pretty much the same thing probably.

Being a Sylph, on the other hand, gives you fuck-knows-what.

Wherein A Young Male Red-Blooded Hero Is An Irresponsibly Altruistic Thief and Catspaw For A Ruling Highblood Who Seeks To Overthrow The Natural Domination Of The Fuschias Through The Use Of The Magical Artifact Releasing A Magical Lusus Which Changes His Blood; The Thief Acquires The Artifact, And Achieves Blackrom With The Purple-Blooded Magician But Their Romance Is Fated With Death; The Fuschia-Blood Auspisticizes Between The Purple-Blood And The Red-Turned-Purple-Blooded Hero; The Red-Turned-Purple-Blooded-Hero Auspisticizes Between The Highblood And The Fuschia Ruler; There Are 16 Deaths; 3 Battle Scenes; Many Romance Scenes; 4 Dance Numbers; And A Musclebeast 

Being a sylph is supposed to be like being the lusus.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="96" name="Doomed!Hazel: Watch Ransha grab the trident" tags="dark" position="1700,800">A shattered hand grabs the bottom of the trident without warning, and you grit your teeth and snatch the weapon away.

If it&#x27;s some kind of monster, you&#x27;re going to protect Tara with your life.

&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ransha-text whisper&quot;&gt;SLF FX MUH&lt;/span&gt;&quot; a flapping mash of teeth blurts.

As you kick the mangled hand off the far end of the trident, Tara concentrates with what you know must be time powers, and the meat suddenly knits back together into a short, grey-skinned humanoid girl. When you pull the trident back into your friend&#x27;s grasp, you hand touches hers, by accident, sending a brief tingle through your fingers.

It&#x27;s hard to pull away from her, but you do. You can&#x27;t help smiling at her, a little, but she doesn&#x27;t smile back.

You glance down, staring into the eyes of the short alien girl, who eyes you with ferocious intent.

She&#x27;s unexpectedly pretty, you think to yourself, before she kicks your legs out from underneath you with blazing speed.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Doomed!Hazel: Fight Ransha]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Doomed!Hazel: Fight Ransha" tags="dark" position="1700,950">You correct your fall instinctively and land on your hands, pushing yourself into a vicious three-kick combination that sweeps away the alien girl&#x27;s defenses before tagging her in the gut and finishing on her chin. Ivory white triangles bounce out of her mouth as her grip locks on your ankle. You let out a gasp as the slight scion swings you over her shoulder with bone-crushing force, crashing into the stones of the allure hard enough that bits of the mortar and loose stone are scattered into the air by the assault.

Even with every molecule of air driven out of your lungs, you kick reflexively, pulling your foe in after you. Catching a rock-hard horn to the chin for your troubles, you put an arm around her neck and begin to choke her. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Go to sleep, Fish bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You punch her in the eye once, twice, three times until she lets go, but she tosses her head back, catching your neck between the ridiculous horns.

With a twist of her neck, she rolls forward and somersaults onto your head, but you lead with your heart. Flopping your feet over onto the ground, you scrabble for a grip on the fish bitch and settle on the horns before using your greater mass as a battering ram, bouncing the two of you gracelessly across the walkway, each impact a bit harder on the pint-sized potentate until she gets her center and tosses you over the edge of the wall.

She waits for a half a second, then smirks evilly as she throws a murderous back elbow... that hits nothing, as you appear in front of her, grab her shoulders and knee her right in the clamset.

The alien girl lets out a musical yelp as the air is driven out of her respiration bladders, but she pushes into the forced doubling-over, grabs your ankles, and flips you ass over teakettle, following with a flying elbow that lands just as you do.

The entire thing hurts like a bitch.

The grey-skinned girl is more experienced than you, and much stronger than you, but you have hot-blooded determination in spades.

But you&#x27;re exhausted, and only half-conscious, and lying prone.

The alien girl sits astride you and reaches down to grab your hand, crunching your fingers together. You don&#x27;t even have the energy to wince in pain. You her her shout, &quot;S&lt;span class=&quot;ransha-text whisper&quot;&gt;TOP&lt;/span&gt; K&lt;span class=&quot;ransha-text whisper&quot;&gt;ILLING&lt;/span&gt; Y&lt;span class=&quot;ransha-text whisper&quot;&gt;OURS&lt;/span&gt; —&quot;

There&#x27;s a //whumph//.

Tara stands before you as your vision clears, holding out an open palm.

You sit up, suddenly refreshed by the presence of the girl you like, and take her hand, getting yourself upright again. You make a half-hearted attempt for a second smooch, but think better of it.

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Who... is that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you ask, as you watch the alien girl stumble to her feet.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;that&#x27;s ransha. and if she doesn&#x27;t knock it off, i&#x27;m gonna seriously reconsider this plan to pull her out of her fucking cage of a universe.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I wasn&#x27;t talking to you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you shout at the alien girl, before turning to Tara. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;No seriously?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Tara demurs to an immediate response. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;if you could just explain what in the fuck all that was about that would be fucking dandy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

This Hero of Time isn&#x27;t being very fair to you. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;She bit me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Tara gives her a long-suffering look that you&#x27;re familiar with by now, and glances to you.

&quot;FUCKING SHUT YOUR STUPID FECULENCE HOLES, BY WHICH I MEAN THE ONES IN YOUR FUCKING FACES,&quot; Ransha says. You and Tara snicker a bit at her expense.

You decide to take advantage of the lighter mood to press on with your initial line of questioning. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Seriously though,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you ask the ponytailed girl, &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;what did Alpha me do to you, tara?

&quot;NO IT&#x27;S FUCKING NOT. YOU FUCKING WITCHED LIAM AND STARTED SNOGGING OLIVIA AND THEN TARA SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT SHE WANTED IN ON SOME OF THAT ACTION BUT SHE HAS NO IDEA WHICH PART&quot;

Your mouth drops open in surprise. Olivia?

Tara blushes uncontrollably, wheels on Ransha and explodes.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;how do you expect me to be on your side to save you when you&#x27;re being such a fucking... a fucking feculence hole! that&#x27;s not your fucking thing to share!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she shouts. It&#x27;s nowhere near the volume that the tiny Condesce can output.

&quot;WHO FUCKING CARES. SHE&#x27;S FUCKING DEAD. I&#x27;M PRACTICALLY DOING YOU A FAVOR AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR SESSION REFRESHED AND ALL DIATRIBED OUT WITHOUT RUINING SHIT BACK AT THE HOMESTEAD. HELL YOU COULD EVEN MAKE OUT WITH HER, SEE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. OH WAIT YOU ALREADY DID WHILE I WAS SMASHED INTO FUCKING GOO&quot; New teeth slide themselves into place in the aquatic girl&#x27;s mouth.

Tara covers her face with her palm.

Judging from her expression, you&#x27;re pretty sure she would rather be the dead one than you right now.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;okay so what&#x27;s your fucking plan out here then?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she says, in a transparent attempt to change the subject. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;i assume you dragged me here to sneak something through the stupid predestiny of a bunch of messages we&#x27;re fated to have and your creepy stalker vision?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&quot;I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO GIVE YOU TOO MUCH, FATTY.&quot;

You leap into a combat pose, but Tara steps in between you and the troll girl with the 2x3dent, suddenly making real insights into troll leadership and diplomacy.

Really, you could be a little bit proud of her.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;okay that is fucking it. enough. i need to know who i&#x27;m supposed to be helping and what bullshit i&#x27;m supposed to be doing, cause i sorta have some kind of plan and tbh i&#x27;m not sure if any plan you have is gonna be a good thing for us.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; says Hazel tersely. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;And some of them might just be as nice as I thought you were. Doesn&#x27;t matter, going to wake them all up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Ransha raises an eyebrow, but says nothing.

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#x27;t reset your session, Tara,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Doomed!Hazel says.  &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;It won&#x27;t work.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She disappears.

You look over to the troll princess, and sigh. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;i think,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you say haltingly, &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;maybe we should just go to your dream bubble now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&quot;FAIR ENOUGH,&quot; she agrees. She holds out a hand.

Oh, right.

You hand the 2x3dent back to the warrior princess, who gives it a confident spin.

The two of you set off in an awkward silence.

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Tara: Cross the border]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="Tara: Cross the border" tags="dark" position="1900,1550">At the end of the dream bubble, where you&#x27;re about to cross into a blurry landscape of grey sands and the light of two moons, Hazel reappears.

Behind Ransha.

The alien girl&#x27;s keen senses give her no warning as she is swept up into a side hug. She squawks in indignant protest. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re friends, Fishbits. Good luck, although I don&#x27;t think you need it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Ransha goes to bite, but gets nothing but air. You hear her teeth clack loudly as she bounces lightly away into a combat pose.

Hazel glides into your vision with neither sound nor motion. &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Give this to Alpha me. If you can&#x27;t take it with you, read it. And then pass it on.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&gt; [[`===&gt;`-&gt;Tara: Take the note]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="Tara: Take the note" tags="dark" position="1900,1850">Your steely facade softens a bit. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;uh, okay,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you say, not unkindly. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;don&#x27;t... whatever can happen to you out here.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#x27;t,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Doomed!Hazel says, eyes sparkling, with determination etched into her face.

That&#x27;s more like the Hazel you know.

The doomed Witch of Space disappears, leaving the two of you, each alien to the other, on the grey sandy shores of Dream Alternia.

A rock whistles through the empty space formerly occupied by Hazel&#x27;s head.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;did you go through all this trouble just to tell me that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; You notice that you&#x27;re trembling, and you try to still yourself so she doesn&#x27;t notice.

&quot;I GOT TO MURDER A HUMAN WITHOUT DOOMING MYSELF, SO I CONSIDER THE SACRIFICE WORTH IT,&quot; the petite princess says, before she sees your face. For the first time, you see an expression of immediate regret trace itself across the troll girl&#x27;s countenance.

&quot;DON&#x27;T BE LIKE THAT. IT&#x27;S HOW WE ARE. THERE ARE TOO MANY TROLL KIDS, WE CAN&#x27;T ALL GROW UP... SO WE FIGHT. NONE OF THIS &#x27;ADULT&#x27; AND &#x27;CHILD&#x27; AND &#x27;ANTI BULLYING CAMPAIGN&#x27; HOOFBEAST SHIT THAT MAKES UP A HUMAN CHILDHOOD.&quot;

The alien girl trails off.

Your eyebrows form an inscrutable juxtaposition, beckoning her to continue.

You shrug faintly. &lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;okay,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you call out. Like every beach trip you&#x27;ve ever been on, the grey sands have somehow made their way into your shoes, and there&#x27;s a silicon crunch between your toes as you begin to trail behind your otherworldly comrade.

&quot;THERE&#x27;S A REASON FOR THAT, TOO,&quot; you hear the heiress say from ahead of you. &quot;TIME IS ALL FUCKED UP OUT HERE. IF YOU STAY IN ONE PLACE, IT HAS A TENDENCY TO NOT PASS ANYWHERE.

&lt;span class=&quot;tara-text dark&quot;&gt;&quot;like you need anymore tools besides the ones you started your session with?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Ransha just ignores this. &quot;WELL TRY AND MAKE THE TROLL WORLD.

No, you need someone who&#x27;s going to think up the weird, dumb ideas that make enough sense to try.

You&#x27;ve been carting your friends around from place to place, and you&#x27;re kind of tired of being the Magic School Bus.

Not that you //mind// it. You&#x27;re the best person for the job, and you believe you should always make sure to get the best person to do the important jobs.

But it takes a lot out of you, using your [[Witch of Space]] powers to teleport everyone around.

So right now, you&#x27;re just taking a few minutes to browse the Internet and concentrate on how to get your friends through this game.

That&#x27;s not the easiest thing for you to do right now, though.

You can do so much cool stuff with this. You can create portals, and slow things down sort-of, and combine multiple locations into one.

But most of the time it means that you just teleport stuff, which you feel like is a waste. You can do so much more!

Being a Witch means you&#x27;re good at sacrifices, and trading, and making deals, and breaking the rules.

You&#x27;re itching to break some rules, but you&#x27;re having trouble thinking of what to break. It&#x27;s a matter of figuring out what the rules are, so that you can break them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="Alchemiter" tags="" position="1000,2050">By using an unnecessarily complicated process involving a strange device called the Alchemiter, raw materials known as grist, and some other stuff that is even more complicated, you can convert objects to punch cards and combine them with other punch cards to create new objects with combined properties.

You&#x27;ve been working industriously with your friends to make all manner of ridiculous useless things like this, such as combining a laser pistol and a crystal prism to make a Color Gun that changes the color of things.

You can also make useful equipment, but that has been a much harder task than you expected.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="You bring up your instant message window." tags="" position="700,1100">&lt;div class=&quot;im-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;im-handle-text&quot;&gt;Zelha:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;Hey, since you are really the best, really the only, person to do this I think it&#x27;s time, no pun intended, we got a better lay of the land.&lt;/span&gt;

That&#x27;s the shitty thing about talking to Tara. Even though she can travel through time, somehow she always takes way too long to reply to your important messages.

Just like that. Her whole //If we just keep doing what we&#x27;re doing everything will be fine// deal is completely wrong-headed. The girl is so passive.

&lt;div class=&quot;im-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;im-handle-text&quot;&gt;Zelha:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;First, if you die and go to the afterlife I think that&#x27;s a one way trip, unless you trust Carver more than you seem to be letting on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;im-handle-text&quot;&gt;Zelha:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hazel-text&quot;&gt;Second, what I&#x27;m saying is what can we do now to get ahead of the curve?&lt;/span&gt;

</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Your Name Is Tara Tan" tags="" position="423,177">Your name is Tara Tan, and you are the heir of a lusty grandma and to a Korean restaurant. You have recently writhed around on a soapy floor with your crippled friend whilst a creepy, anthropomorphic animal ambiguously pleasured himself. More recently, you&#x27;ve driven a car and been shot at by maniacs, and you have this idea that you can&#x27;t shake that you can save your friend Olivia from dying, even though it already happened. You have made a mental note to survey the roadside for the perpetrators of some roadside sniping, and have traveled into the past to enact your master plan to save Olivia&#x27;s body from death without contradicting the things that have been experienced.

Unfortunately, your attempts to conjure a convincing vr simulacrum to sneak onto Olivia&#x27;s head met with a goofy helmet full of descending green lines of code and a box set of Sword Art Online. You may yet come up with another solution, however.

It occurs to you that if you had an item like that, you would be able to recontextualize almost any event experienced by a single person, and that would just be waaaaay too convenient to be real.

You are at the Alchemiter, on the Sidewalk of your Family Home and Korean Restaurant.

You can &#x27;&#x27;Go Inside&#x27;&#x27;.
There is an &#x27;&#x27;Alchemiter&#x27;&#x27;, a &#x27;&#x27;Punch Designix&#x27;&#x27;, a &#x27;&#x27;Jumper Block Extension&#x27;&#x27; and several &#x27;&#x27;Crocodiles&#x27;&#x27; around.

Despite his small stature and effeminate coloring, something about the way this crocodile is carrying himself seems different. Dangerous. Like, you might want to cross the street if he were walking towards you on it. He has the look and swagger of a reptile that has never tried to walk like he wasn&#x27;t holding, maybe lost a few teeth outside a club for his skills.

It occurs to you at this juncture that as cool as the idea of a rapping purple crocodile seems, you yourself are no rapper at all. You might get served. Hard.

The little crocodile draws his microphone, settling into an easy back and forth stride, never letting eyes of you for a moment. One clawed hand pulls the mic up to the side of his snout while his other adjusts his cap.

Give it up, for that hero in purp
Just flowin, smooth with the power

Cause in this life there&#x27;s only one winner
You better aim straight so you can hit the center
In it to win it, With a team of six
Consort Croco gonna take on all you dicks


Villains you better run and hide
Because one day you might not slide
So choose, your weapon don&#x27;t slip
Croco&#x27;s in control with the flex of the mic grip
Rockin&#x27; the crowd the way it should be rocked
With the Grassland drop that you like a lot
You know it&#x27;s hittin, Like a denizen
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level
The power of the Croco is strong
Fightin the crooks &#x27;til they&#x27;re all gone

Two tanned, muscular firefighters pose on the calendar, while a cardboard standup of Fight Club era Brad Pitt is pasted to the wall. Assorted korean snacks are relatively organize along the living space, and there is a large, comfortable bed with a desk that rolls partly under the bed to allow you to browse comfortable while supine. Assorted tchotchkes cover the fronts of bookshelves full of books, mostly in Korean. And then there is a dvd case full of Korean Dramas, and a few Univision ones with subtitles.

Two imps are jumping on the bed, slapping each other with bags of dried squid.
