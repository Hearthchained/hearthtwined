You have recently writhed around on a soapy floor with your crippled friend whilst a creepy, anthropomorphic animal ambiguously pleasured himself. More recently, you&#x27;ve driven a car and been shot at by maniacs, and you have this idea that you can&#x27;t shake that you can save your friend Olivia from dying, even though it already happened. You have made a mental note to survey the roadside for the perpetrators of some roadside sniping, and have traveled into the past to enact your master plan to save Olivia&#x27;s body from death without contradicting the things that have been experienced.

Unfortunately, your attempts to conjure a convincing vr simulacrum to sneak onto Olivia&#x27;s head met with a goofy helmet full of descending green lines of code and a box set of Sword Art Online. You may yet come up with another solution, however.

It occurs to you that if you had an item like that, you would be able to recontextualize almost any event experienced by a single person, and that would just be waaaaay too convenient to be real.

You are at the Alchemiter, on the Sidewalk of your Family Home and Korean Restaurant.

You can &#x27;&#x27;Go Inside&#x27;&#x27;.
There is an &#x27;&#x27;Alchemiter&#x27;&#x27;, a &#x27;&#x27;Punch Designix&#x27;&#x27;, a &#x27;&#x27;Jumper Block Extension&#x27;&#x27; and several &#x27;&#x27;Crocodiles&#x27;&#x27; around.

A Crocodile with a backwards cap has appeared, making hand motions you associate with a freestyle rap battle challenge.

Almost as out of place as Family Korean Restaurant looks on top of a stony spire above a savanna.

It does seem to love producing quirky pop culture artifacts, and plenty of Japanese cartoon related bullshit. Bring on the Harry Potter,  you think at the dull metal machine&#x27;s features.

Liam did the most with his, and it was pretty sweet, particularly how it can create things at a distance, rather than on the appearification pad.

[[&gt; say hi to crocodiles]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="&gt; rap battle" tags="" position="1144,956">The crocodile narrows his eyes, his purple skin and pupils narrowing from slits to darkly ominous lines as he crosses his arms at the wrist, before moving them out in a semicircle away from his body until his hands sit perpendicular to his little hips, like a gunslinger. Despite his small stature and effeminate coloring, something about the way this crocodile is carrying himself seems different. Dangerous. Like, you might want to cross the street if he were walking towards you on it. He has the look and swagger of a reptile that has never tried to walk like he wasn&#x27;t holding, maybe lost a few teeth outside a club for his skills.

It occurs to you at this juncture that as cool as the idea of a rapping purple crocodile seems, you yourself are no rapper at all. You might get served. Hard.

The little crocodile draws his microphone, settling into an easy back and forth stride, never letting eyes of you for a moment. One clawed hand pulls the mic up to the side of his snout while his other adjusts his cap.



&#x27;&#x27;YO! It&#x27;s the Purple machine
Gonna rock the town without being seen
Have you ever seen Croco Get Down?
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound
Yeah, everybody let&#x27;s move
Croco is here with the Grass Canon Groove
Gonna rock, And roll this place
With the power of the reptile bass
Croco, ya know what im sayin
Devastate the show while the heroes are playin



Consort, Consort, RAP! Consort, Consort, RAP! GO GO GO GO!
Go Consort, Go Consort, GO: Go Consort, Go Consort, GO!

Lyrics, fill in the gap
Drop that bass and get the Croc RAP
Taste it, Like I done [buuuurp]
Give it up, for that hero in purp
Just flowin, smooth with the power 
Kickin&#x27; it up, Hour after hour
Cause in this life there&#x27;s only one winner
You better aim straight so you can hit the center
In it to win it, With a team of six
Consort Croco gonna take on all you dicks


Villains you better run and hide
Because one day you might not slide
So choose, your weapon don&#x27;t slip
Croco&#x27;s in control with the flex of the mic grip
Rockin&#x27; the crowd the way it should be rocked
With the Grassland drop that you like a lot
You know it&#x27;s hittin, Like a denizen
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level
The power of the Croco is strong
Fightin the crooks &#x27;til they&#x27;re all gone



Consort, Consort, RAP! Consort, Consort, RAP! GO GO GO GO!
Go Consort, Go Consort, GO: Go Consort, Go Consort, GO!

The little Crocodile drops the mic.

You&#x27;re not sure what you were expecting.



A small crowd of Crocodiles appears, drawn by the siren song of MC Croco. They stare at you expectantly.

You&#x27;ve just been inundated with some questionable rap lyrics that remind you of something.

You are not sure how to solve your predicament. If only there were someone with an intrinsic insight into the workings of the medium paired with a zeal for rigorous experimentation and science that could help you.

There are sprites, but they&#x27;re unnecessarily cryptic. And there&#x27;s Glados, who is a science loving robot, currently tearing things up over at Liam&#x27;s house. Maybe she could help? the housing for the portal looms over the top of your house.

A small crowd of Crocodiles stares at you expectantly. MC Croco is stylin on you.

Two tanned, muscular firefighters pose on the calendar, while a cardboard standup of Fight Club era Brad Pitt is pasted to the wall. Assorted korean snacks are relatively organize along the living space, and there is a large, comfortable bed with a desk that rolls partly under the bed to allow you to browse comfortable while supine. Assorted tchotchkes cover the fronts of bookshelves full of books, mostly in Korean. And then there is a dvd case full of Korean Dramas, and a few Univision ones with subtitles.

Two imps are jumping on the bed, slapping each other with bags of dried squid.
